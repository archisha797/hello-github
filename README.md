# hello-github
Just getting started with GitHub
This is my first public repository â€” a space to start learning version control and get comfortable using GitHub.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s here:
- Basic C programs (hello world, loops, functions, etc.)
- Practice files from coursework and tutorials
- README written by a very tired but determined CS student ðŸ˜…

## ðŸ’» Tech Stack:
- C Programming Language
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code / Any basic C IDE

## ðŸ“š In Progress:
- Data types & variables in C
- Conditional statements
- Loops and functions
- Simple logic problems

## ðŸ¤– Why this repo exists:
I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science (AI & ML) at KIIT.  
This repo helps track my learning journey â€” one program (and bug) at a time.
